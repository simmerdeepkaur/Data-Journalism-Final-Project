# From Kabul to California - The Jouney of an Exiled Journalist
_As conflicts emerge in different corners of the world, journalists brave enough to fight the power are forced to abandon their motherland and live in exile. Khwaga Ghani is one such journalist who was able to escape the Taliban rule in her country and eventually ended up in California's Bay Area. Read the full story here._ <br>

As Afghanistan collapsed on August 15, 2021, so did Khwaga Ghani’s dreams and goals for her motherland. In the end, she had no option but to flee her home. Now, she lives in California’s San Francisco Bay Area, a life circumstantially chosen for her, in exile. 

“When I left home, I had one carry-on bag, important documents, two pairs of clothes and that’s it,” Ghani said.

Once the US announced the withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan, the Taliban launched an offensive, taking over several provincial capitals of the country. To escape their extremist methods, citizens started fleeing to Kabul, the nation’s capital, hoping to find protection from the Islamic fundamentalist group. To their dismay, the Taliban eventually entered Kabul, overwhelming Afghan security forces and taking control of the presidential palace. 

Soldiers abandoned their posts, some surrendered to the Taliban, and the Afghan government collapsed. The 20-year US-led military campaign in Afghanistan officially came to an end. The United States ended its longest war of bloodshed. For Afghanistan, after more than one year of Taliban rule, the country still lives in fear and uncertainty.

Khwaga Ghani is one of many journalists who had to flee their country if they wanted a shot at living a decent life, or in some cases, having a life at all. For Ghani, this decision came at the cost of leaving behind her home and a life she had been looking forward to.

“I had so many plans for my life and for my future that I'd be reporting from Afghanistan. I'll have this career and I'll be working with NPR for a long time, and I probably will get married. But everything collapsed,” she added.

Ghani was born in the Wardak province of Afghanistan in 1984. The country was in a state of turmoil because of a civil war that started after the Soviet-backed Afghan government fell in 1992. The Taliban, formed in the early 1990s, started gaining control of the nation shortly after. By 1996, they had captured Kabul and ruled approximately three-quarters of the country till 2001. Their methods were extremist and often merciless towards women, religious minorities and political opponents, among other groups.

But Ghani’s parents wanted a more free life for their children. When she was six, her family moved to Pakistan where they lived as refugees. She grew up with her two siblings in Islamabad, where she attended school and university. 

Meanwhile, the Taliban were providing a safe haven for Al-Qaeda, a Sunni pan-Islamist militant organization. Founded by Osama bin Laden, the jihadist group was responsible for the attacks that shook the entire United States to its very core. The terrorist strike of 9/11 made Laden one of the most wanted men on the planet. Thus began the USA's worldwide hunt for the terrorist leader. As a part of the campaign against Al-Qaeda, US forces eventually occupied Afghanistan. They waged a war against the Taliban and routed them from power. 

“When the US came along, a lot of opportunities came for women,” Ghani said. 

Even though this move by the US government led to its fair share of problems in Afghanistan, it also gave the citizens a chance to understand what freedom from the Taliban meant. People started getting educated and respecting women’s rights. Fathers now understood the importance of their daughters attending school. Circumstances started becoming more liberal. Many people who had left the country returned to their motherland, for it was no longer ruled by extremist methods. Ghani’s family was one of them.

After moving back to Kabul in 2011, Ghani started her career as an English instructor at a university and later worked as a public relations officer at an independent human rights commission center. In 2015, she received an offer from HBO Vice, which was working on a documentary about women’s rights in Afghanistan. She worked with them as a reporter and translator. This marked the inception of Ghani’s journalism career. In 2019, she started working with National Public Radio (NPR) as a stringer. She reported stories, including breaking news from Afghanistan, for NPR’s bureau in Islamabad. 

In 2021, Kabul fell again. The US withdrew its last remaining forces from Afghanistan on August 30, 15 days after the Taliban insurgency.

When this news broke out, Ghani was working with Amnesty International on a report about war crimes. Her fellow researcher at the time, who had come from New York, immediately rushed to the airport. As for Ghani, she went back home and stayed indoors for four days. She was desperate for any opportunity to escape with her family because she knew home wouldn’t be safe for much longer.

After almost 100 hours, Ghani received a call from a friend at Vice News. He connected her to a coordinator who was escorting journalists to a safe house in Kabul. Ghani and her family left immediately. They had neither the time nor the space to carry luggage. Ghani had heard that the Taliban were forcefully seizing documents so people couldn’t leave the country. But she also knew the Taliban wouldn’t touch women. So she hid her documents under her _abaya_. She reached the safehouse with her parents and sister. Their journey, however, was far from over.

The next step was finding a way to fly out of the country. After staying at the safehouse for another four days, she received a call again. This time, it was a friend from the New Yorker, who had chartered a plane solely for journalists, that would fly from Kabul to Macedonia and then to the US.

Ghani arrived at the Kabul International Airport with her family. Since the window of opportunity for people to escape was getting shorter, the airport was only getting more crowded and chaotic. “It was a very bad situation, people were jumping over the walls of the airport,” Ghani added. 
Her family spent two nights at the airport, sleeping on the runway, until they found out that the plane chartered for them had been occupied by the wrong people. About 150 Afghan civilians had boarded the flight and refused to get off despite the pilot’s instructions, who kept announcing the plane was chartered for someone else. For two days, the plane stayed on the runway and nobody got down. Finally, the pilot had to take off. 

Ghani could not stay at the airport much longer and she could not go back home. Her family then joined the evacuees who were in line for the US military planes that were flying 500 people at a time. Finally, they landed at a military airport in Qatar. After one day, the same plane flew to Ramstein Base, a US Air Force Base in Germany, where the refugees stayed for four days and nights. 

“We didn't know what was going on, actually, because nobody would tell you the next step,” Ghani said. She kept asking the soldiers where the plane was traveling next. “Get on the plane, you'll know where you're going to land,” they would reply. 

While leaving Germany, they finally had a legitimate answer. They were now boarding a flight to the Dulles International Airport in Washington DC. From there, they traveled to another military camp in Wisconsin called Fort McCoy. On October 8, they came out of the camp after all their official documents were processed. Once the formalities were sorted, they bought their tickets for San Francisco where Ghani’s brother had been living for the past four years. Her mother’s side of the family had previously moved to the Bay Area as well. In October 2021, the entire family united at the SF airport after 40 years.

Today, Ghani is a first-year student at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism and lives in Fremont with her family. She wishes for two things, to resume reporting for Afghanistan and to go back home. 

“My desire for journalism and telling stories has kept me going, I will never hold back,” she added. 

Khwaga Ghani’s story not only represents the setback for her country and women but also for journalists and democracy. But her story is not the only one. 

Lina Shirzad was also a female journalist in Afghanistan and a voice for its women. She had worked as a reporter for 13 years. As a journalist with Voice of America, an international radio broadcaster, Shirzad reported on the narcotics beat. Every time she prepared a story, accusations of being an infidel followed. She received threats from various people who disapproved of her working relationship with Americans. 

The threats became more intense after the Taliban usurpation. Shirzad was explicitly told when the Badakhshan province fell that she would be executed. The fear in her heart grew stronger, not just for her own, but for her family’s safety. To protect her loved ones, Shirzad had to flee from her home. Now, she lives in Sacramento, California where she works at a restaurant packing food orders and as a videographer for a production company. Unlike Ghani, she could not bring her family along. “I just want to meet my mom once and give her a big hug,” Shirzad said.

For both Ghani and Shirzad, “home will always be Afghanistan.”

Many more journalists like them had to flee their motherland due to the continuing attacks on journalists. In the end, they all wish for the same thing - to go back home.

According to data collected by the Committee to Protect Journalists, 2,195 journalist executions have been recorded across the globe between 1992-2023. “Everything that is happening at the moment paradoxically makes the profession (of journalism) all the more important,” said Anna Brakha, a Europe and Central Asia researcher with CPJ. 

These journalists come from different countries and political contexts but have met the same fate of either execution or exile. Their journeys are a mirror to the brutal truth of the dying press freedom globally. 

# Data Diary 

I worked with two data collected by the Committee to Protect Journalists. One of them records the data of journalists killed in different countries across the globe between 1992-2023, and the second dataset deals with journalists imprisoned during the same years. <br>
__Dataset 1__ <br>
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RNGkXAhT6N41vJlNs5OoLhUuHdKYMWqb0FLblOrbgWg/edit#gid=1094018745 <br>
__Dataset 2__ <br>
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RNGkXAhT6N41vJlNs5OoLhUuHdKYMWqb0FLblOrbgWg/edit#gid=518864641 <br>


## Data Analysis

__Question 1:__ How many journalist killings were committed in each country between 1992-2023? Which countries have overseen the most deaths? What position was Afghanistan on this list? <br>
__Answer:__  Iraq (253), Philippines (156) and Syria (155) oversaw the most number of killings. Afghanistan was number 10 on the list, with a total of 79 deaths. The number of deaths in each country are mentioned in the table below. <br>
__Steps:__ 
* Froze the first row of the main dataset (journalists and media workers killed between 1992 and 2023). <br>
* Sorted the data from a-z in the year column, to have the entire dataset organized year wise. <br>
* Clicked on insert and then pivot table, making sure my cursor is on the first cell of the table, so the range of the pivot table includes the whole dataset. <br>
* While editing the pivot table, inserted ‘full name’ in the values, because that is a unique value for each entry, since no two journalists had the same full name. <br>
* Inserted ‘country’ in rows. <br>
* Organized the country row by ‘descending’ order and sorted by ‘COUNTA of full name.’ <br>
* Used COUNTA for sorting values so that the pivot table counts everything including numbers and text, and not just numeric values. <br>
__Pivot Table:__ (https://github.com/simmerdeepkaur/Data-Journalism-Final-Project/blob/main/Ranking%20of%20Countries%20in%20Terms%20of%20Number%20of%20Executions%20.csv) 


__Question 2:__ How did the number of deaths and imprisonments change before, during and after the USA occupied Afghanistan, between 1992-2023? <br>
__Answer:__ Before the US occupied the country (1992-2000) = 2 killings <br>
During (2000-2020) = 76 <br>
After (2021-2023) = 3 imprisonments and 5 killings. <br>
__Steps:__ 
* Inserted a new pivot table. <br>
* Added ‘full name’ in values and summarized by ‘COUNTA.’ <br>
* Inserted ‘country’ in rows. Organized by ‘ascending’ order and sorted by ‘country.’<br>
* Inserted ‘year’ in rows. Organized by ‘ascending’ order and sorted by ‘year.’<br>
* Inserted ‘status’ in rows. Organized by ‘ascending’ order and sorted by ‘status.’<br>
* Selected ‘country’ in the filter option. Ticked off all countries, except Afghanistan.<br>
* Next, I created a new spreadsheet and manually entered the entries of imprisonment. I collected this data from the CPJ website, but since there was no option to download this dataset, I manually entered it. <br>
* Finally, I created a new table, combining the entries of both killings and imprisonment. <br>
__First Pivot Table:__ (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RNGkXAhT6N41vJlNs5OoLhUuHdKYMWqb0FLblOrbgWg/edit#gid=29405273)

__Question 3:__ Which beats were the journalists covering who were targeted the most in Afghanistan?<br>
__Answer:__ War, Politics and Human Rights (according to the data recorded; note that some entries are missing from the dataset).<br>
__Steps:__
* Inserted a new pivot table.<br>
* Added ‘full name’ in values and summarized by ‘COUNTA.’<br>
* Inserted ‘country’ in rows. Organized by ‘descending’ order and sorted by ‘COUNTA of full name.’<br>
* Inserted ‘coverage’ in rows. Organized by ‘descending’ order and sorted by ‘COUNTA of full name.’<br>
* Selected ‘country’ in the filter option. Ticked off all countries, except Afghanistan.<br>
